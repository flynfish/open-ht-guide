* Buy Green Glue \(GG\) in 5 gallon buckets to save money.
* Get the Speed Loader application gun. Itâ€™s like a giant syringe that you use to draw the GG up from the bucket and squirt on the drywall. Also have a pint of Acetone handy. 
  * Lubricate the Gun periodically with WD40
* Two full loads of GG are required for each 4x8 sheet, more if using larger panels
* Stick the gun in the GG only up the base of the nozzle, any deeper and you will be getting GG on your hands for the rest of the day
* Have a 5 gallon bucket 2/3 full of warm water with a generous amount of dish soap handy when you are starting the day. Also a couple of clean shop towels that you can get wet and wipe up spills. A puddle of GG is a magnet for your shoes and you will track it around the project site resulting in the equivalent of Fly Paper. Clean up your spills. 
* After you have emptied two loads onto the drywall, make sure the gun is empty and stick it in the bucket of water rather than trying to find a place to lay the gun as it will drip all over and create a mess. The water will keep any remaining GG from getting tacky.
* If you need to clean off your hands stick them in the bucket as soon as possible and wipe off. If they become sticky Acetone on a rag will remove the GG.
* When you get down to last few inches of GG in the bucket the Speed Loader will no longer suck up the remainder. You need to either scape the remains into a fresh bucket or using a tool scrape and fling it directly onto the next drywall sheet. If you leave the last few inches and dispose, you will be wasting about $25 of material per bucket. I find that having some disposable nitrile exam gloves are useful when it comes time to scrape the bucket. A scrap piece of drywall about 5x10 inches makes a great scraping tool, then toss in the trash. 
* When it is break time, draw a load of the soapy water up into the speed loader and let sit in the bucket of water.
* At the end of the day you can either completely clean and lubricate the gun \(30-60 minutes\) or simply rinse out with a few loads of the soapy water, draw up a full load of water and let sit in the bucket of water. If several days will pass before you use the gun again flush it daily with soapy water.
* Start the next day with a fresh bucket of warm soapy water.
