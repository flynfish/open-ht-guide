# Putty Pads

### Putty Pads

Install them on every outlet box in your room to keep sound from escaping

### HVAC Duct Putty

These can be used as an alternative to acoustic putty pads.

* They are effective, inexpensive and readily available. 
  * Pick them up at any Home Depot or Lowes for $3 for a 1 pound package. 
* Use about half a pound on each outlet. 
  * That's only $1.50 per outlet. 
  * It also works out to be a lot thicker and more effective than the much thinner pre-made putty pads.

Warm the putty block in the microwave and they will be easy to mold and work with. They are also sticky, so wear disposable gloves!
